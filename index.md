# StartLens (Beta)

## Judgment-disciplined competitive intelligence

StartLens produces executive-ready competitive briefs that answer one question:

> What, if anything, materially changed about competitors this week—and does it warrant action?

When nothing meaningful changed, StartLens says so clearly.

This behavior is intentional: StartLens follows a judgment-gated workflow that can downgrade, refuse, or halt analysis based on evidence quality rather than filling gaps with speculation.
---

## What StartLens Is

- An **input-only** competitive intelligence operator  
- Designed for executives, product leaders, and strategy teams  
- Optimized to detect **material change—or confidently say “no change”**  
- Built to avoid hype, speculation, and hallucination  

---

## What StartLens Is Not

- Not real-time monitoring  
- Not web browsing or scraping  
- Not automated competitor tracking  
- Not predictive strategy  

These constraints are deliberate.

---

## How It Works

1. You paste competitor inputs (pricing pages, blogs, press releases, etc.)
2. StartLens analyzes **only what you provide**
3. You receive a concise, executive-ready brief
4. “No material change” is a valid and common outcome by design
