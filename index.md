# StratLens (Beta)

## Judgment-disciplined competitive intelligence

StratLens produces executive-ready competitive briefs that answer one question:

> What, if anything, materially changed about competitors this week—and does it warrant action?

When nothing meaningful changed, StratLens says so clearly.

---

## What StratLens Is

- An **input-only** competitive intelligence operator  
- Designed for executives, product leaders, and strategy teams  
- Optimized to detect **material change—or confidently say “no change”**  
- Built to avoid hype, speculation, and hallucination  

---

## What StratLens Is Not

- Not real-time monitoring  
- Not web browsing or scraping  
- Not automated competitor tracking  
- Not predictive strategy  

These constraints are deliberate.

---

## How It Works

1. You paste competitor inputs (pricing pages, blogs, press releases, etc.)
2. StratLens analyzes **only what you provide**
3. You receive a concise, executive-ready brief
4. “No material change” is a valid and common outcome by design

---

## Beta Notice

- Outputs reflect only the inputs you provide  
- Confidence reflects **evidence strength**, not market certainty  
- Missing inputs yield a procedural “no assessment possible” result

## Feedback (Optional)

After using StratLens, ask yourself:

> Would I forward this unedited to a senior leader? Why or why not?
